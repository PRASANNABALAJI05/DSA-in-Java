# DSA and ArrayList in Java

## What is DSA?
**DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)** is the study of how data is organized, stored, and processed efficiently, along with the techniques (algorithms) used to solve computational problems.  
It focuses on:
- **Data Structures** → Ways to store and organize data (e.g., arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs).
- **Algorithms** → Step-by-step procedures to solve problems efficiently (e.g., sorting, searching, traversal).

Mastering DSA helps in:
- Writing efficient and optimized code.
- Improving problem-solving skills.
- Performing well in technical interviews.

## What is ArrayList in Java?
An **ArrayList** in Java is a resizable array implementation from the `java.util` package.  
It can dynamically grow or shrink as elements are added or removed, unlike regular arrays which have a fixed size.

**Key Features:**
- Stores **objects** (including wrapper classes for primitives).
- Maintains **insertion order**.
- Allows **duplicate elements**.
- Provides fast **random access** by index.
- Slower when inserting or deleting in the middle (due to shifting elements).
- Supports built-in methods for adding, removing, updating, and searching elements.

**Common Use Cases:**
- Storing and managing dynamic collections of data.
- Maintaining lists where the number of elements changes frequently.
